What good is data without a good plot to tell the story! - is the basis of this project. 

Dataset Description -

I used a dataset that has data about anti-cancer drug regimens and its success. In this dataset, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
