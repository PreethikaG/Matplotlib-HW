What good is data without a good plot to tell the story! - is the basis of this project. 

Dataset Description -

I used a dataset that has data about anti-cancer drug regimens and its success. In this dataset, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

Process,Analysis and Visualizations -

Read the CSV's in to DataFrames.
Perform merging of DataFrames.
Generate a summary statistics table (with mean,median,variance,standard deviation) for the tumor volumne of each drug regimen.
Use Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize the data using bar charts,pie charts,line charts,scatter plots.
Use IQR (to quantitatively)and boxplot(to qualitatively) calculate if there are any potential outliers and verify that the results match.
Caluculate the correlation coefficient and generate a liner regression model for the drug regimen.
